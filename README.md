Alot of individuals think that to use R or a programming language at work you need to be a software engineer, data analyst, data scientist etc. This can be discouraging to some who donâ€™t work in this discipline and want to break into this field, but presently work an administrative or sales role that does not require or need such skills.

But there are a variety of admistrative tasks that implimenting R can prove useful- even at the entry level. What if I told you that you can automate prospecting emails and mail merges with R? This is of particular importance if you are looking to prospect new clients, run a campaign for your organization or network with other businesses and move past introductions and save time.

This blog post is based on personal experience of what I have used for businesses to automate the prospecting process and have successfully avoided their spam folder to my knowledge (i.e. all prospects I reached out to got back to me).

NOTE: But in this post we are going to look at how to Automate Mail merges ( or Email Blasts)
The problem:

To keep things simple, suppose I have gathered a list of leads with names and emails which for emailing purposes is enough data to make a simple mail merge (or email blast).

(Of course, for our case- this data is made up)

buisness_owners <- data.frame(Name=c("Aaron","Susan","Tim"),
                              Email=c("aaron_gillman@aaronsties.com", "sue@suesflowers.ca","tim@buckto.org"))

buisness_owners

##    Name                        Email
## 1 Aaron aaron_gillman@aaronsties.com
## 2 Susan           sue@suesflowers.ca
## 3   Tim               tim@buckto.org
